Task Repetition & Maintenance

    Diminishing Returns: Repeated completion of the same task too frequently yields less Aura.
    Bonus Aura for "Stale" Tasks: Old, uncompleted tasks give bonus Aura when finally completed.

    Hidden "Integrity Score": Invisible metric tracking player honesty based on task completion patterns.
    Dynamic Penalties: Reduced Aura gain or negative in-game events if "Integrity Score" drops due to suspicious activity.
    Long-Term Milestone Gating: Endgame unlocks require sustained, believable effort over time, not just peak Aura.
    Time-Locked Progression: Certain benefits are gated by real-world time elapsed, preventing rapid cheating.

Custom Skill Trees ("Knowledge & Effort" System)

    Skill Point Earning: Completing real-life tasks grants custom "Skill Points."
    Unlockable Abilities: Points can be spent in themed skill trees (e.g., Productivity, Focus, Mindfulness) to unlock passive in-game benefits.
    Examples of Abilities: Faster breaking speed, improved potion durations, slower hunger depletion, increased health regeneration, reduced fall damage.
