# 1. Introduction

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the features and functionalities of the "Productivity & Decay" Minecraft mod, aiming to gamify real-world productivity through in-game progression and maintenance. This mod transforms Minecraft into a dynamic representation of the player's discipline, where in-game capabilities are directly tied to real-life task completion.

# 2. Product Overview

The "Productivity & Decay" mod is a total conversion Minecraft mod designed for single-player use (with potential for future multiplayer compatibility) that gates all major in-game progression and abilities behind real-world tasks. The mod introduces a "Productivity Aura" that constantly decays over real-world time, requiring consistent task completion to maintain in-game power and progression. It operates on an "honor system" with built-in mechanisms to discourage abuse.

# 3. Goals & Objectives

* **Primary Goal:** To motivate players to complete real-world tasks by linking their in-game Minecraft progression and abilities directly to their productivity.
* **Objective 1:** Create a robust "Productivity Aura" system that accurately tracks real-world time and provides a clear in-game consequence for inactivity.
* **Objective 2:** Implement a tiered ability system where in-game actions, crafting, and progression are gated by current Aura level.
* **Objective 3:** Develop an intuitive "Chronicle of Deeds" GUI for managing real-world tasks and tracking Aura.
* **Objective 4:** Incorporate anti-abuse mechanisms to maintain the integrity of the "honor system."
* **Objective 5:** Provide visual and auditory feedback to enhance player immersion and understanding of their Aura status.

# 4. Core "Productivity Aura" System

* **Real-world Time-Based Decay**: "Productivity Aura" constantly decreases over real-world time (configurable rate).
* **Task-Based Aura Gain**: Completing defined real-world tasks grants "Productivity Aura" in relevant categories.
* **Categorized Aura**: Aura is gained in different categories (e.g., Health, Intelligence, Social, Organization, Creative), influencing specific in-game buffs and debuffs.
* **Daily Reset Penalty**: A configurable significant Aura decay if no tasks are completed within a 24-hour real-world period.
* **Persistent Data**: All Aura levels and task data save and load correctly with the Minecraft world.

# 5. "Chronicle of Deeds" (GUI)

* **Hotkeyed Access**: Opens via a dedicated hotkey or unloseable item.
* **Task Management**: Allows players to add, edit, delete, and mark real-world tasks as complete.
* **Task Details**: Tasks can be assigned names, categories, and "Effort Levels" (Small, Medium, Large).
* **Aura Display**: Shows current "Productivity Aura" level and currently unlocked ability tiers for all categories.
* **Confess Cheat Button**: A self-reporting mechanism for acknowledging and penalizing cheating.

# 6. Tiered Abilities & Progression Gating

In-game abilities and progression are directly tied to your Aura levels across different categories. As your Aura increases, you unlock beneficial effects and remove debuffs. Conversely, low Aura levels impose significant challenges.
