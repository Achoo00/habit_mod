1. Introduction

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the features and functionalities of the "Productivity & Decay" Minecraft mod, aiming to gamify real-world productivity through in-game progression and maintenance. This mod transforms Minecraft into a dynamic representation of the player's discipline, where in-game capabilities are directly tied to real-life task completion.
2. Product Overview

The "Productivity & Decay" mod is a total conversion Minecraft mod designed for single-player use (with potential for future multiplayer compatibility) that gates all major in-game progression and abilities behind real-world tasks. The mod introduces a "Productivity Aura" that constantly decays over real-world time, requiring consistent task completion to maintain in-game power and progression. It operates on an "honor system" with built-in mechanisms to discourage abuse.
3. Goals & Objectives

    Primary Goal: To motivate players to complete real-world tasks by linking their in-game Minecraft progression and abilities directly to their productivity.
    Objective 1: Create a robust "Productivity Aura" system that accurately tracks real-world time and provides a clear in-game consequence for inactivity.
    Objective 2: Implement a tiered ability system where in-game actions, crafting, and progression are gated by current Aura level.
    Objective 3: Develop an intuitive "Chronicle of Deeds" GUI for managing real-world tasks and tracking Aura.
    Objective 4: Integrate anti-abuse mechanisms to encourage honesty within the honor system.
    Objective 5: Provide clear visual and auditory feedback for Aura level changes and associated in-game effects.

4. Target Audience

Single-player Minecraft users who:

    Are looking for external motivation to be more productive in real life.
    Enjoy gamified self-improvement.
    Are comfortable with a challenging and potentially restrictive Minecraft experience initially.
    Are willing to engage with an "honor system" for self-accountability.

5. Functional Requirements
5.1. The "Productivity Aura" System

    FR-A1: The mod shall track a "Productivity Aura" value for each player, persistent across game sessions.
    FR-A2: "Productivity Aura" shall constantly decay over real-world time, regardless of whether the player is in-game. The decay rate shall be configurable (default: 1 point per minute, possibly faster at higher Aura levels).
    FR-A3: A configurable daily "Aura Reset" shall occur, decaying a larger chunk of Aura if no tasks are completed within a real-world 24-hour period.
    FR-A4: "Productivity Aura" shall increase upon marking a task complete in the "Chronicle of Deeds." The amount gained shall be dependent on task difficulty/effort level.
    FR-A5: "Productivity Aura" shall be categorized (e.g., Physical, Mental, Organizational, Creative), with different categories potentially contributing to specific in-game buffs or unlocks.

5.2. "Chronicle of Deeds" (GUI)

    FR-CD1: The mod shall provide an uncraftable, unloseable in-game item or hotkey that opens a custom GUI called the "Chronicle of Deeds."
    FR-CD2: The "Chronicle of Deeds" GUI shall display:
        A list of active tasks.
        Current "Aura Level" (numerical and/or bar indicator).
        Currently unlocked abilities/tiers.
        A button to add new tasks.
        Buttons to edit existing tasks.
        Buttons to delete tasks.
        Buttons to mark tasks as complete.
        A "Confess Cheat" button with associated consequences.
    FR-CD3: Players shall be able to add tasks with a name, category, and an assigned "Effort Level" (e.g., Small, Medium, Large).
    FR-CD4: Marking a task as complete shall update the player's Aura and record the real-world timestamp.
    FR-CD5: The GUI shall load and save task data persistently.

5.3. Ability Tiers & Progression Gating

    FR-AT1: The mod shall define distinct "Aura Tiers" (e.g., Tier 0, Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, Tier 4) corresponding to specific Aura level ranges.
    FR-AT2: Tier 0 (Aura 0-50): The Incapable Builder
        Players shall have severely restricted abilities: very slow movement, low health, permanent hunger/weakness debuffs.
        Players shall be unable to effectively mine most blocks (except dirt/leaves), and vanilla crafting (beyond 2x2) shall be disabled.
        Vanilla inventory access shall be extremely limited.
    FR-AT3: Tier 1 (Aura 51-150): The Awakened Apprentice
        Unlocks: Effective wood/stone mining, 3x3 crafting table, basic furnace functionality, slightly improved movement/health.
        Reversion: If Aura drops below 51, abilities revert to Tier 0.
    FR-AT4: Tier 2 (Aura 151-300): The Diligent Crafter
        Unlocks: Iron tools/armor crafting recipes, basic Redstone components (levers, buttons, basic pistons), Villager trading.
        Reversion: If Aura drops below 151, abilities revert to Tier 1.
    FR-AT5: Tier 3 (Aura 301-500): The Master Builder
        Unlocks: Diamond tools/armor crafting recipes, advanced Redstone (observers, dispensers, complex circuits, hoppers), automated farm building recipes, Enchanting Table functionality, Nether portal activation.
        Reversion: If Aura drops below 301, abilities revert to Tier 2.
    FR-AT6: Tier 4 (Aura 501+): The End-Game Luminary
        Unlocks: Netherite upgrade recipes, Elytra functionality, End Portal activation.
        Reversion: If Aura drops below 501, abilities revert to Tier 3.
    FR-AT7: The mod shall dynamically enable/disable vanilla crafting recipes based on the player's current Aura Tier.
    FR-AT8: The mod shall modify block breaking/interaction mechanics (e.g., effective tools, break speed) based on the player's current Aura Tier.
    FR-AT9: The mod shall gate dimensional travel (Nether, End) based on the player's Aura Tier and potentially specific task completions. This includes modifying Nether portal activation and Eye of Ender mechanics.

5.4. Task Repetition & Freshness

    FR-TR1: Each task shall track a "freshness" timer (configurable, default 24-48 hours) from its last completion.
    FR-TR2: Completing a task within its "freshness" period shall refresh its timer.
    FR-TR3: Completing the same task too frequently (e.g., within 6 hours) shall result in diminishing Aura returns or no Aura gain for that completion.
    FR-TR4: Tasks that haven't been completed for a configurable long period (e.g., 3+ days) shall grant bonus Aura upon completion as a "catch-up" mechanism.

5.5. Visual & Auditory Feedback

    FR-VF1: A persistent HUD element shall display the player's current "Aura Level."
    FR-VF2: As Aura levels drop, the in-game world shall subtly desaturate visually.
    FR-VF3: As Aura levels drop, the player model shall visually reflect decay (e.g., less vibrant, translucent, negative particle effects).
    FR-VF4: Aura changes shall be accompanied by subtle auditory cues (e.g., draining sound for decay, positive hum for gain).
    FR-VF5: Dynamic in-game music shall become more ominous or sparse as Aura decays.
    FR-VF6: Standard Minecraft debuff icons (e.g., Weakness, Mining Fatigue, Slowness) shall be displayed when Aura drops below specific tiers.

5.6. Anti-Abuse ("Honor System") Mechanisms

    FR-AA1: The "Chronicle of Deeds" GUI shall include a "Confess Cheat" button. Activating this shall result in a significant Aura loss, potential loss of recent progress, or severe temporary debuffs.
    FR-AA2: The mod shall periodically present "Truth Quests" within the "Chronicle," posing reflective questions about honesty in task completion.
    FR-AA3: The mod shall track an invisible "Integrity Score" for the player.
    FR-AA4: The "Integrity Score" shall decrease if:
        Too many tasks are marked complete too quickly.
        Very high-value tasks are marked complete within seconds of each other.
        A "Truth Quest" is falsely answered positively, followed by suspicious activity.
    FR-AA5: If "Integrity Score" drops below a threshold, Aura gain from tasks shall be significantly reduced (e.g., 50%) or negative in-game events shall trigger (e.g., random mob spawns, debuffs, XP gain reduction).
    FR-AA6: High-tier unlocks (Netherite, End Portal) shall require cumulative Aura earned over time or consistent task completion streaks, discouraging short-term cheating.
    FR-AA7: Certain in-game benefits or advancements may be "time-locked," only becoming available after a specific real-world duration has passed since the last successful task completion, regardless of Aura.

5.7. Custom Skill Trees (Knowledge & Effort)

    FR-ST1: The mod shall introduce custom skill trees (e.g., Productivity, Focus, Mindfulness).
    FR-ST2: Completing real-life tasks shall grant "Skill Points" for these custom trees.
    FR-ST3: Players shall be able to spend "Skill Points" to unlock specific in-game passive abilities (e.g., faster breaking speed, improved potion durations, slower hunger depletion).

6. Non-Functional Requirements

    NFR-P1 (Performance): The mod shall not cause significant client-side or server-side lag. Aura decay calculations and event handling must be optimized.
    NFR-U1 (Usability): The "Chronicle of Deeds" GUI shall be intuitive and easy to navigate for task management.
    NFR-M1 (Maintainability): The codebase shall be modular, well-commented, and adhere to Forge best practices for ease of future updates and bug fixes.
    NFR-C1 (Compatibility): The mod shall be compatible with Minecraft 1.20.1 using Forge. Future compatibility with newer Minecraft versions will be addressed in maintenance phases.
    NFR-D1 (Persistence): All mod data (Aura, tasks, timestamps, Integrity Score, skill points) shall be correctly saved and loaded with the Minecraft world and player data.
    NFR-S1 (Security - Internal): The internal data storage should be resistant to simple user tampering (though a dedicated cheat is acknowledged).
    NFR-I1 (Installation): Installation shall follow standard Forge mod installation procedures (dropping the .jar file into the mods folder).

7. Future Considerations (Out of Scope for V1.0 MVP)

    Multiplayer compatibility.
    Integration with external productivity APIs (e.g., Pomodoro timers, habit trackers).
    More complex custom mobs or world generation specific to Aura tiers.
    Advanced cheat-proofing mechanisms that involve network verification (not feasible without external APIs).
