1. Introduction

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the features and functionalities of the "Productivity & Decay" Minecraft mod, aiming to gamify real-world productivity through in-game progression and maintenance. This mod transforms Minecraft into a dynamic representation of the player's discipline, where in-game capabilities are directly tied to real-life task completion.

2. Product Overview

The "Productivity & Decay" mod is a total conversion Minecraft mod designed for single-player use (with potential for future multiplayer compatibility) that gates all major in-game progression and abilities behind real-world tasks. The mod introduces a "Productivity Aura" that constantly decays over real-world time, requiring consistent task completion to maintain in-game power and progression. It operates on an "honor system" with built-in mechanisms to discourage abuse.

3. Goals & Objectives

   Primary Goal: To motivate players to complete real-world tasks by linking their in-game Minecraft progression and abilities directly to their productivity.
   Objective 1: Create a robust "Productivity Aura" system that accurately tracks real-world time and provides a clear in-game consequence for inactivity.
   Objective 2: Implement a tiered ability system where in-game actions, crafting, and progression are gated by current Aura level.
   Objective 3: Develop an intuitive "Chronicle of Deeds" GUI for managing real-world tasks and tracking Aura.
   Objective 4: Integrate anti-abuse mechanisms to encourage honesty within the honor system.
   Objective 5: Provide clear visual and auditory feedback for Aura level changes and associated in-game effects.

4. Target Audience

Single-player Minecraft users who:

    Are looking for external motivation to be more productive in real life.
    Enjoy gamified self-improvement.
    Are comfortable with a challenging and potentially restrictive Minecraft experience initially.
    Are willing to engage with an "honor system" for self-accountability.

5. Functional Requirements
   5.1. The "Productivity Aura" System

   FR-A1: The mod shall track a "Productivity Aura" value for each player, persistent across game sessions.
   FR-A2: "Productivity Aura" shall constantly decay over real-world time, regardless of whether the player is in-game. The decay rate shall be configurable (default: 1 point per minute, possibly faster at higher Aura levels).
   FR-A3: A configurable daily "Aura Reset" shall occur, decaying a larger chunk of Aura if no tasks are completed within a real-world 24-hour period.
   FR-A4: "Productivity Aura" shall increase upon marking a task complete in the "Chronicle of Deeds." The amount gained shall be dependent on task difficulty/effort level.
   FR-A5: "Productivity Aura" shall be categorized (e.g., Physical, Mental, Organizational, Creative), with different categories potentially contributing to specific in-game buffs or unlocks.

5.2. "Chronicle of Deeds" (GUI)

    FR-CD1: The mod shall provide an uncraftable, unloseable in-game item or hotkey that opens a custom GUI called the "Chronicle of Deeds."
    FR-CD2: The "Chronicle of Deeds" GUI shall display key information and functionality as detailed in the **GUI Design Specification (GUI.md)**, including:
        A list of active tasks.
        Current "Aura Level" (numerical and/or bar indicator) for overall Productivity and individual Aura categories.
        Currently unlocked abilities/tiers.
        Task management features (add, edit, delete, complete).
        A "Confess Cheat" button.
    FR-CD3: Players shall be able to add tasks with a name, category, and an assigned "Effort Level" (e.g., Small, Medium, Large).
    FR-CD4: Marking a task as complete shall update the player's Aura and record the real-world timestamp.
    FR-CD5: The GUI shall load and save task data persistently.

5.3. Aura Category Tiers & Progression Gating

    FR-AT1: The mod shall define distinct "Aura Tiers" (0-20, 21-50, 51-100, 101-150, 151+) for each individual Aura category, as well as for an aggregate "Productivity Aura." In-game abilities and progression shall be dynamically enabled, disabled, or modified based on these Aura levels. If an Aura level drops below a tier threshold, abilities shall revert to the lower tier.

    FR-AA2: The mod shall periodically present "Truth Quests" within the "Chronicle," posing reflective questions about honesty in task completion.
    FR-AA3: The mod shall track an invisible "Integrity Score" for the player.
    FR-AA4: The "Integrity Score" shall decrease if:
        Too many tasks are marked complete too quickly.

        A "Truth Quest" is falsely answered positively, followed by suspicious activity.
    FR-AA5: If "Integrity Score" drops below a threshold, Aura gain from tasks shall be significantly reduced (e.g., 50%) or negative in-game events shall trigger (e.g., random mob spawns, debuffs, XP gain reduction).
    FR-AA6: High-tier unlocks (Netherite, End Portal) shall require cumulative Aura earned over time or consistent task completion streaks, discouraging short-term cheating.
    FR-AA7: Certain in-game benefits or advancements may be "time-locked," only becoming available after a specific real-world duration has passed since the last successful task completion, regardless of Aura.

5.7. Custom Skill Trees (Knowledge & Effort)

    FR-ST1: The mod shall introduce custom skill trees (e.g., Productivity, Focus, Mindfulness).
    FR-ST2: Completing real-life tasks shall grant "Skill Points" for these custom trees.
    FR-ST3: Players shall be able to spend "Skill Points" to unlock specific in-game passive abilities (e.g., faster breaking speed, improved potion durations, slower hunger depletion).

6. Non-Functional Requirements

   NFR-P1 (Performance): The mod shall not cause significant client-side or server-side lag. Aura decay calculations and event handling must be optimized.
   NFR-U1 (Usability): The "Chronicle of Deeds" GUI shall be intuitive and easy to navigate for task management.
   NFR-M1 (Maintainability): The codebase shall be modular, well-commented, and adhere to Forge best practices for ease of future updates and bug fixes.
   NFR-C1 (Compatibility): The mod shall be compatible with Minecraft 1.20.1 using Forge. Future compatibility with newer Minecraft versions will be addressed in maintenance phases.
   NFR-D1 (Persistence): All mod data (Aura, tasks, timestamps, Integrity Score, skill points) shall be correctly saved and loaded with the Minecraft world and player data.
   NFR-S1 (Security - Internal): The internal data storage should be resistant to simple user tampering (though a dedicated cheat is acknowledged).
   NFR-I1 (Installation): Installation shall follow standard Forge mod installation procedures (dropping the .jar file into the mods folder).

7. Future Considerations (Out of Scope for V1.0 MVP)

   Multiplayer compatibility.
   Integration with external productivity APIs (e.g., Pomodoro timers, habit trackers).
   More complex custom mobs or world generation specific to Aura tiers.
   Advanced cheat-proofing mechanisms that involve network verification (not feasible without external APIs).
