Based on the ambitious scope and complexity of this mod, here are some theoretical issues that are highly likely to arise during development and testing:
General & Modding API Related

    Save Data Corruption: Incorrect handling of custom persistent data (Aura, tasks, timestamps) leading to data loss or world corruption upon game exit/crash.
    Forge API Quirks: Unexpected behavior or limitations with specific Forge hooks (e.g., recipe overrides, player capability system).
    Inter-Mod Compatibility: While designed for single-player, other Forge mods might cause unforeseen conflicts, especially with recipe/block interaction modifications.
    Performance Overhead: The constant real-world time tracking, Aura decay, and application of effects could lead to minor client-side lag if not optimized.
    Tick-Based Glitches: Precise timing for Aura decay or effect application might be slightly off due to Minecraft's tick-based nature.

"Productivity Aura" & Tier System

    Aura Calculation Drift: Discrepancies between calculated Aura decay/gain and displayed Aura, potentially due to floating-point inaccuracies or timer synchronization issues.
    Tier Transition Bugs: Abilities/recipes not correctly unlocking or revoking precisely at Aura threshold crossings.
    Debuff/Buff Overlap: Conflicting potion effects or status effects from vanilla Minecraft or other sources interacting unexpectedly with the mod's debuffs/buffs.
    Player Respawn Handling: Aura state and abilities not correctly reset or maintained upon player death and respawn.

"Chronicle of Deeds" GUI

    GUI Rendering Issues: Buttons misaligning, text overflowing, or visual glitches when resizing the Minecraft window.
    Input Handling Conflicts: Hotkey for GUI clashing with other mods or vanilla Minecraft controls.
    Task List Management Bugs: Tasks not saving/loading correctly in the GUI, or issues with editing/deleting tasks.

Anti-Abuse ("Honor System")

    False Positives in Integrity System: Legitimate rapid task completion (e.g., small, quick chores in real life) being flagged as cheating.
    Easily Exploitable Edge Cases: Clever players finding specific sequences of actions that bypass the anti-abuse logic without being detected.
    Player Frustration: Penalties being too harsh or unclear, leading to player resentment rather than motivation.
    "Truth Quest" Spam: Quests appearing too frequently, becoming annoying rather than thought-provoking.

Game Balance

    Unbalanced Decay Rates: Aura decaying too quickly, making progress impossible, or too slowly, trivializing the challenge.
    Unbalanced Aura Gain: Tasks giving too much or too little Aura, making progression too fast or too slow.
    Tier Progression Difficulty: Jumps between tiers being too easy or too difficult to achieve/maintain.
    Early Game Frustration: Tier 0 being too restrictive, leading to players quitting before they can make meaningful progress.
    Endgame Trivialization: High Aura levels making the game too easy, losing the core challenge.

Visual & Auditory Feedback

    Desaturation Glitches: World desaturation not applying consistently, or causing visual artifacts.
    Particle/Sound Spam: Overuse of particles or sounds becoming distracting or annoying.
    HUD Overlap: Aura indicator conflicting with other HUD elements from vanilla or other mods.

Technical Implementation

    Timestamp Synchronization: Ensuring real-world timestamps for task completion are accurate across game sessions and potential system clock changes.
    Custom Recipe System Complexity: Implementing and managing complex dynamic recipe enabling/disabling for potentially hundreds of vanilla recipes.
    Event Listener Order Issues: Mod's event listeners firing in an unexpected order, causing logic errors.
